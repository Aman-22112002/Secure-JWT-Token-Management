Title: Secure JWT Token Management with Spring Boot

Description:
This Spring Boot application demonstrates secure JWT (JSON Web Token) token management for accessing data from a database. It incorporates Bcrypt password hashing for enhanced security.

Features:
1. JWT-based authentication: Utilizes JWT tokens for secure access to protected resources.
2. Bcrypt password hashing: Encrypts passwords using Bcrypt for improved security.
3. User registration and login: Allows users to register and log in to the application.
4. Data access: Provides access to protected data based on authenticated JWT tokens.

Prerequisites:
1. Java 8 or later
2. Spring Boot 2.x or later
3. Required Spring Boot dependencies (e.g., Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web)
4. A supported database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

Configure database:
1. Create a database user and database.
2. Update the database connection settings in application.properties.


Authentication:
Register a new user:
1. Fill in the registration form and submit.

Log in:
1. Enter your username and password.
2. Click the "Login" button.

Accessing Data:
1. Once logged in, you can access protected data using authenticated JWT tokens.
2. The application will automatically include the JWT token in subsequent requests.

Security Considerations:
1. JWT secret key: Keep the JWT secret key confidential to prevent unauthorized access.
2. Password hashing: Use a strong password hashing algorithm like Bcrypt to protect user passwords.
3. Token expiration: Set appropriate token expiration times to limit the lifetime of access tokens.
